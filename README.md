 Git Hub Transfer - Mini Challenge #1 "What is your name?"
 This is a console project that will ask the user their name
 and report it back to the console

 Peer Review by: Christopher Prado 
 Your MiniChallenge was completed concisely and effectively. Although, I noticed on line 16 the word "afternoon" was spelled "aftertnoon"
